>After winning the International Dance Music Award for Best Music Event in Miami for the first time in 2012, Tomorrowland had officially become the most global festival on earth. A whopping two million people visited the website of the festival, hoping to score a ticket – over ten times more than the number of available tickets. Tomorrowland launches its own YouTube channel in 2012 – broadcasting DJ sets, interviews and behind-the-scenes features. With well over eight million people tuning in, Tomorrowland quickly and easily becomes the most-watched music festival on the planet. Its official after movie adds another one hundred million views (and still counting) to that claim.
