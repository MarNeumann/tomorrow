>An exceptional and challenging year called for new ventures to explore… On the cancellation of Tomorrowland Winter in France and the summer edition in Belgium due to COVID-19, Tomorrowland took a leap into the wonderful digital world, opening the doors to the future on the magical island of Papilionem with the first edition of Tomorrowland Around the World on July 25 & 26. Closing off the year in style with a magical New Year’s Eve celebration, people from all corners of the world counted down to 2021 and danced into the new year at Tomorrowland 31.12.2020.
